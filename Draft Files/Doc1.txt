This feels really great to install ubuntu in my machine. I would like to check how File diff command works to check difference between two documents. I read in the idratherbewriting.com to find the diffences using the docs to doc methodology then to manually checking for the changes in the refence documents.

As one step closer to this I have installed Ubuntu and the command prompt is up and running. I got my user name and password. It is really great to install everything and see it working fine. I am loving this. Let me see if the file diff can identify the difference in the word doc.
This is the first document. Let me add few articles
