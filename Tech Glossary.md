**Vendor-Agnostic Service**
A vendor-agnostic service is a solution that works with multiple technology providers, rather than relying on a single vendor's products or services. This approach offers greater flexibility, avoids vendor lock-in, promotes compatibility across different systems, and allows businesses to access best-of-breed tools, ensuring adaptability, competition, and future readiness in a dynamic market. 

**Manifest**
In telemetry, a "manifest" serves as metadata describing the data, often specifying its format, origin, or how it was collected. A Data Manifest provides context for interpreting telemetry data by detailing characteristics like the platform, collection timing, and metering conditions, ensuring the data's reliability and meaning. It is similar to other data and is streamed alongside the telemetry it describes.

**Utility in terms of Software**

In software, a utility (or utility software) is a program designed to perform specific, often technical, tasks to help maintain, manage, and optimize a computer system's performance, functionality, or security. Unlike application software which directly serves end-user needs, utility software supports the infrastructure by handling tasks such as file management, virus detection, data backup, and disk repair.
