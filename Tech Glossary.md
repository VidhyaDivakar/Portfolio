**Vendor-Agnostic Service**
A vendor-agnostic service is a solution that works with multiple technology providers, rather than relying on a single vendor's products or services. This approach offers greater flexibility, avoids vendor lock-in, promotes compatibility across different systems, and allows businesses to access best-of-breed tools, ensuring adaptability, competition, and future readiness in a dynamic market.

**Manifest**
In telemetry, a "manifest" serves as metadata describing the data, often specifying its format, origin, or how it was collected. A Data Manifest provides context for interpreting telemetry data by detailing characteristics like the platform, collection timing, and metering conditions, ensuring the data's reliability and meaning. It is similar to other data and is streamed alongside the telemetry it describes.

**Utility in terms of Software**

In software, a utility (or utility software) is a program designed to perform specific, often technical, tasks to help maintain, manage, and optimize a computer system's performance, functionality, or security. Unlike application software which directly serves end-user needs, utility software supports the infrastructure by handling tasks such as file management, virus detection, data backup, and disk repair.

**Synapse**

Synapse is  **the transmission site from the pre-synaptic to the **post-synaptic** neuron** . The structures found on either side of the synapse vary depending on the type of synapse: Axodendritic is a connection formed between the axon of 1 neuron and the dendrite of another. These tend to be excitatory synapses.

**Monotonic**

In monotonic reasoning,  **once the conclusion is taken, then it will remain the same even if we add some other information to existing information in our knowledge base** . In monotonic reasoning, adding knowledge does not decrease the set of prepositions that can be derived.

Example: Even if the loan risk factor increases, the decision to release of loan money does not changes.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**

CSS is the core styling language for web pages, directly interpreted by web browsers. SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a preprocessor scripting language that extends CSS with additional features, offering a more powerful and efficient way to write styles.

Key Differences:

* **Compilation:**

  CSS is directly understood by browsers. SCSS, being a preprocessor, needs to be compiled into standard CSS before it can be rendered by a browser. This compilation step is typically handled by build tools or task runners.
* **Features:**

  SCSS introduces features not natively available in CSS, such as:* **Variables:** Define reusable values for colors, fonts, etc., promoting consistency and easier updates.

  * **Nesting:** Nest CSS selectors within each other, mirroring the HTML structure and improving readability.
  * **Mixins:** Create reusable blocks of styles that can be included in multiple selectors, reducing code repetition.
  * Inheritance (`@extend`): Share styles between selectors, promoting a more modular and efficient codebase.
  * **Partials and Importing:** Modularize CSS by creating smaller, organized files (`_partial.scss`) that can be imported into a main SCSS file.
* **Syntax:**

  SCSS uses a syntax that is a superset of CSS, meaning any valid CSS code is also valid SCSS code. This makes it easier to transition from CSS to SCSS.
* **Debugging:**

  CSS variables can be inspected directly in browser developer tools. SCSS variables are compiled away, so only their substituted values are visible in the browser's CSS.
* **Suitability:**

  Plain CSS is sufficient for small, simple projects or when a direct, uncompiled approach is preferred. SCSS is particularly beneficial for larger, more complex projects where its features significantly enhance maintainability, organization, and development efficiency.

**What is the use of .js files?**

A `.js` file is a **JavaScript file** — it stores reusable JavaScript code that runs **in the browser** (client-side) or on a **server** (if using Node.js).

It’s like the “brain” of your website.

HTML is the “skeleton,” CSS is the “skin,” and JS makes it “move.”

**What are .SVG files?**

An .svg file is a Scalable Vector Graphics file. It is an XML-based image format for describing two-dimensional vector graphics, such as icons, logos, diagrams, and illustrations.

Key points about SVG files:

* They are text files that define graphics using shapes (like lines, circles, and paths) and text.
* SVG images are resolution-independent and scale without losing quality, making them ideal for web and interface design.
* You can view and edit SVG files in any text editor, or use graphic design tools like Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, or directly in web browsers.
* SVGs can be styled and animated with CSS and JavaScript.

Example SVG code:

**XML**

```
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="blue" />
</svg>
```

This code draws a blue circle in a 100x100 pixel area.
